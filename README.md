# **Blockchain Enabler Platform**

This project is about creation of a blockchain platform which would allow the user to easily select from different blockchain and
generate an organization where the selected blockchain would be used for private data storage and collaborative efforts.

Currently the user can create the blockchain network, invite other parties to this network and also leave the network.
All of this is done and the user can use the docker volumes or decide not using them.
