// inside here instead of in the enabler_manager.

// Few things need to be changed

// 1. the structure and the interfaces need to be changed a bit
// 2. Not so sure about the applicability of the enabler as well as the manager dont really know if it would be necessary

// 2.1 The main idea behind the enabler manager is to run multiple enablers at the same time
// 2.2 Also to manage the members(the port informations) for each of the enablers such that no new enabler is given the same port
// 2.3 The things most important to work with now is to generate the config file and then loading the config file.
// 2.4 Once the config file is loaded then using the docker containers to run the setup.

// Current order of how things will be implemented
// Tuesday -> working on cleaning the code structure a bit + creating the config file (currently without worrying about ports)
// Wednesday -> if the config file is getting generated, the main task is to create the keys, and the other things needed to load the config
// 				which would be to check the firefly code for inspiration on how to generate the keys and then run the keys inside(/outside)
// 				if the keys are common then they need to be stored in our local host machine.
// Thursday -> working on the proposal a bit the idea is to have a basic create network done by this week along with the class diagram.

// The work seems a lot but can be definitely done just need to keep at it and avoid making the same mistakes i have made earlier.
// Things get better and easier you just have to do it every day.

// Also need to keep a track of how far i have progressed every day or every two days, keep a plan for that.

// I really need to finish the main stuff this week before the call as might open up a possiblity for job offer which i need to search now.
