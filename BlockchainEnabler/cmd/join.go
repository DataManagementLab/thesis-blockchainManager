	// once the join -c org3 -p org1 is done then
	// first it will check the org3 is present -> check throuh the user and the network and then bring up the network .
	// Currently would create the org3 files which are necessary and then generate the org3.json file in the folder

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// joinCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// joinCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
