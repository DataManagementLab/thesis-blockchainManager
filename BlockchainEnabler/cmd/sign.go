	There are two options with the sign command,
	1. Without update : The peer just endorses the transaction, but does not update the network.
	2. With update: The peer endorses the transaction and updates the network, usually done by the last organization to sign a transaction to reach majority of endorsements.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// signCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// signCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
